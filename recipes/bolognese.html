    <h1>Slow Cooker Bolognese</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ragù alla bolognese is a slowly cooked meat-based sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including sweating, sautéing and braising. Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery, and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato paste or tomato sauce are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length to produce a thick sauce. <br> <br> Outside Italy, the phrase "Bolognese sauce" is often used to refer to a tomato-based sauce to which minced meat has been added; such sauces typically bear little resemblance to Italian ragù alla bolognese, being more similar in fact to ragù alla napoletana from the tomato-rich south of the country. Although in Italy ragù alla bolognese is not used with spaghetti (but rather with flat pasta, such as tagliatelle), in countries such as the United States and Australia "spaghetti bolognese" has become a popular dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped baby carrots</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add carrots, onion, and garlic; sauté until tender, about 10 minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir, breaking up the meat as it cooks, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off excess fat from the skillet.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1 cup milk and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until milk is absorbed, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker and set to High. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cover and cook for 2 hours. Stir in remaining 1/2 cup milk and Parmesan cheese until well combined; continue to cook for 2 more hours.</li>
    </ol>
